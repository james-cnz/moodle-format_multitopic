  In order to edit the course sections faster
  As a teacher
  I need to be able use some edit tools without ajax.

  Background:
    Given the following "course" exists:
      | fullname     | Course 1   |
      | shortname    | C1         |
      | category     | 0          |
      | format       | multitopic |
      | collapsible  | 0          |
      | numsections  | 3          |
      | initsections | 1          |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | name              | intro                       | course | idnumber | section |
      | assign   | Activity sample 1 | Test assignment description | C1     | sample1  | 1       |
